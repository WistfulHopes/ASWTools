# ASWTools

A collection of tools for modding modern Arc System Works fighters. Currently, it contains a tool for working with BBScript. The reason I made a new tool was partially to challenge myself, and partially to write a tool that more closely follows Arc System Works' own conventions. As a result, there is a larger deviation in syntax from existing tools (such as @super-continent 's wonderful BBScript repo, or @dantarion 's venerable bbtools repo).
